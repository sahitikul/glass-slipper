This app allows users to upload a picture of a celebrity they look up to and would like makeup advice from. 
Our app then takes that celebrity and detects some of there main traits including gender, age, and basic facial features.
Then, it provides the user with specified makeup products and tips similar to the style of their favorite celebrity.
This way, users can find products that their favorite celebs use and add them to their own routines. 
Thus, allowing them to have a similar routine to someone they look up to! This can lead to more confidence and inspire creativity.
